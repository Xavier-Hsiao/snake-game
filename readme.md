# Snake Game

## About the project
Almost everyone, at least of my generation, played snake game on Nokia mobile phone before. This project reproduces that experience using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to play the game?
First press space key to start the game then use your keyboard to control the snake. Eat food as much as you can until hitting the walls or touching your tail.

The top-right corner will display your current score and after your first attempt, the top-left corner will show up the latest high score record.
